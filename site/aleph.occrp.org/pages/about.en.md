OCCRP Aleph is an investigative data platform that helps reporters to **follow the money**. We provide access to a vast archive of public records, open databases and leaked material. You can search the data, upload your own files to a personal dataset or sketch a diagram to summarise your investigative findings.

### What data is in Aleph?

Aleph contains material from a [wide range of sources](/datasets). We’re focussed on collecting data that will help us track assets and corporate ownership, government expenditure, and information on individuals and groups of journalistic interest. We also import leaked archives and corporate data with journalistic relevance. Our geographic focus is on Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, South America, and various offshore jurisdictions.

The archive is built in tandem with our stories - often, we scrape or index material relevant to ongoing investigations.

On a technical note: Aleph is not just a document search engine. Aleph also imports structured data from spreadsheets and databases, enabling journalists to store not only data about persons of interest, companies, financial transactions, and more.

### Applying for journalist access

Much of the Aleph archive is protected from public access due to concerns about data protection and civil rights. OCCRP may grant access to journalists with a track record of sound editorial judgement. 

Please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/Dm9eLbecFNKnAtRGA) if you would like to receive access to protected material on Aleph (“Friends of OCCRP” access). Journalists who are part of cross-border investigative projects with OCCRP are granted access implicitly.
