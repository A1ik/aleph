CfAfrica: Aleph
===============

`aleph` is a tool for indexing large amounts of both unstructured (PDF, Word, HTML) and structured (CSV, XLS, SQL) data for easy browsing and search. It is built with investigative reporting as a primary use case.

This documentation covers the technical details of CodeForAfrica's implementation of `aleph`. It's intended for a developer audience. This is not the user guide.

Before proceeding here, please read the `README on github <https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/aleph/blob/master/README.md>`_.
