Aleph is an open project, we're happy to welcome contributions from anybody
that help us make a better tool.

Please note that **we use GitHub issues to track software defects and
enhancements**. It is not a support mechanism. If you're trying to install
Aleph on your own computer and need help, please:

1. Make sure you've read the documentation (https://docs.alephdata.org),
   especially the technical troubleshooting sections.
   
2. Join our Slack channel at http://slack.alephdata.org to interact with the
   community and get advice and help.

3. Only once you're **certain that the problem you are seeing is a bug**
   (and not a local configuration issue), file a report on GitHub for it.
   
Thanks very much, we look forward to working with you!
