  category: procurement
  summary: >
    A subset of Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) data covering public procurement
    for the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the former Yugoslav Republic
    of Macedonia from 2006-01-01 to 2016-12-31.

    This data includes the most important fields from the contract notice and
    contract award notice standard forms, such as who bought what from whom, for
    how much, and which procedure and award criteria were used.

    Generally, the data consists of tenders above the procurement thresholds. However,
    publishing below threshold tenders in TED is considered good practice, and thus
    a non-negligible number of below threshold tenders is present as well.
