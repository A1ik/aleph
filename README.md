document-driven investigations tools
====================================

This is a collection of tools for ingesting, normalizing, indexing and
tagging documents in the context of a journalistic investigation. 

These tools are intended to be complementary to existing platforms such
as [DocumentCloud](http://documentcloud.org) and
[analice.me](http://analice.me).
